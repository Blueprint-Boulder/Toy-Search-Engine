However, because of the harsh and shortened season the pupae might take two years to develop into an adult with eggs overwintering the first year and older larvae hibernating a second time (Pyle, 2002).'),(2,'Pipevine Swallowtail','http://coloradofrontrangebutterflies.com/pipevine-swallowtail/','Battus philenor',' Black above with a single row of pale spots along trailing edge of wings; more evident on females.
